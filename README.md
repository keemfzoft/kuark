# Kuark Visual Kit (Experimental)

**Kuark** is a niche, lightweight, expressive *visual kit* for building frontend apps built with native JSX and powered by Vite. It's designed for developers who value semantic clarity and composable architectureâ€”without the overhead of heavy frameworks. It supports concurrent rendering through Web Workers.

## ðŸ§ª Ideal For

- Building microfrontends with branded UI atoms.
- Prototyping visual flows with semantic clarity.
- Architecting modular design systems with scoped theming.

**Kuark** is more than a *visual kit*â€”it's a developer experience philosophy. It invites you to build with intention, name with poetry, and ship with confidence.

## ðŸ“¦ Demo
